1/ Pass-by-value
	-When the function does not modify the actual paramater, and
	-the paramater is small and efficient to copy like simple types(int, char, double, etc)


2/ Passby-reference using pointers
	- when the function does modify the actual paramater
	- the paramater is expensive to copy
	- Its Ok to pointer is allowed a null value (pass-reference using referemce can't be null)

3/ Pass by-referece using a pointer to const
	- when the function does not modify the actual paramater
	- the paramater is expensive to copy 
	-Its OK to the pointer is allowed a nullptr value

4/ Pass by -referennce using a const pointer to const
	- when the function does not modify the actual paramater
	- the paramater is expensive to copy
	- Its Ok to the pointer is allowed a nullptr value
	- You don't want to modify the pointer itself

5/ Pass-by-reference using a reference
	- when the function does modify the actaul paramater
	- the paramater is expensive to copy
	- the paramater will never be nullptr

6/ Pass-by-reference using a const reference
	- when the function does not modify the actaul paramater
	- the paramater is expensive to copy
	- the paramater will never be nullptr
